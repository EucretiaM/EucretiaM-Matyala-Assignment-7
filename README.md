# Introduction to the Kanban Board Templates

In agile development and project management, Kanban boards play a crucial role in visualizing workflow, tracking tasks, and improving efficiency. Different templates exist to cater to various team needs, including basic task tracking, automated workflows, and team planning. Below is a structured comparison of these Kanban board templates, highlighting their features and statuses.

## Overview of the Kanban Board Templates

The Kanban Board system provides different templates to manage project tasks effectively. Each template serves a unique purpose and provides a clear visualization of task progress. The three primary templates are:

### 1. **Basic Kanban**
- Designed for simple task management with three main columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done.
- Best suited for small teams or personal projects.
- Provides manual task movement across the board.

### 2. **Automated Kanban**
- Integrates automation for workflow management.
- Supports task assignments, due dates, and status updates through predefined rules.
- Ideal for teams requiring efficiency in tracking and minimizing manual effort.

### 3. **Team Planning Kanban**
- Designed for collaborative projects with multiple team members.
- Supports detailed backlog management and prioritization.
- Enhances visibility of team progress across different stages.

## Key Status Categories

| Status      | Description                          | Task Count |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| **Todo**    | Tasks that have not been started yet. | 0          |
| **In Progress** | Tasks currently being worked on.  | 0          |
| **Done**    | Tasks that have been completed.    | 0          |

## Key Objectives

The primary objectives of these Kanban templates are:

- **Enhance Workflow Visibility**: Provide clear visualization of task status.
- **Improve Task Management**: Ensure efficient tracking and prioritization.
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Support teamwork and transparency.
- **Streamline Automation**: Reduce manual workload with automated status updates.

## Target Audience
These templates are designed for:

- **Project Managers**: Who need to track team progress efficiently.
- **Agile Teams**: Looking for structured task visualization.
- **Developers & Designers**: Managing iterative tasks in a project lifecycle.
- **Freelancers & Small Teams**: Seeking a lightweight, easy-to-use task board.

Custom Kanban Board Creation  

## 1. **Added ‘Testing’ Column**  
   - **Purpose**: To align with QA (Quality Assurance) requirements and ensure tasks are properly tested before deployment.  
   - **Benefit**: Provides a clear distinction between completed development work and tasks that need verification before release.  

## 2. **Added ‘Block’ Column**  
   - **Purpose**: To track tasks that are currently blocked due to dependencies, issues, or missing information.  
   - **Benefit**: Helps in identifying roadblocks early, ensuring efficient problem resolution and smoother workflow progression.  

## 3. **Separated ‘Done’ from ‘Testing’**  
   - **Purpose**: To track tasks that have been implemented but require validation before being fully marked as completed.  
   - **Benefit**: Helps in maintaining accountability and preventing premature closure of tasks.  

## 4. **Maintained ‘Todo’ and ‘In Progress’ Columns**  
   - **Purpose**: To organize tasks based on their current development state.  
   - **Benefit**: Provides a clear workflow from ideation to execution.  

## 5. **Task Categorization Using Draft Labels**  
   - **Purpose**: To indicate that certain features are still in the design or initial development phase.  
   - **Benefit**: Ensures visibility into early-stage tasks before they move into active development.  

## 6. **Explicit Task Descriptions**  
   - **Purpose**: To provide clarity on each development task (e.g., ‘Develop upload button’ or ‘Emailing API’).  
   - **Benefit**: Improves collaboration by making tasks easy to understand.  

## 7. **Linked Issues**  
   - **Purpose**: To ensure development tasks align with user story requirements.  
   - **Linked Issue**: *"User Story Creation"* from **Assignment 6** serves as a reference for defining and aligning tasks with required user stories.  
   - **Benefit**: Helps track progress against initial requirements and ensures all features are built as per defined user needs.  

These customizations improve workflow visibility, streamline QA processes, and provide a structured approach to handling blocked tasks efficiently.
