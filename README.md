Customization Choices in Task Management Board  

## 1. **Added ‘Testing’ Column**  
   - **Purpose**: To align with QA (Quality Assurance) requirements and ensure tasks are properly tested before deployment.  
   - **Benefit**: Provides a clear distinction between completed development work and tasks that need verification before release.  

## 2. **Added ‘Block’ Column**  
   - **Purpose**: To track tasks that are currently blocked due to dependencies, issues, or missing information.  
   - **Benefit**: Helps in identifying roadblocks early, ensuring efficient problem resolution and smoother workflow progression.  

## 3. **Separated ‘Done’ from ‘Testing’**  
   - **Purpose**: To track tasks that have been implemented but require validation before being fully marked as completed.  
   - **Benefit**: Helps in maintaining accountability and preventing premature closure of tasks.  

## 4. **Maintained ‘Todo’ and ‘In Progress’ Columns**  
   - **Purpose**: To organize tasks based on their current development state.  
   - **Benefit**: Provides a clear workflow from ideation to execution.  

## 5. **Task Categorization Using Draft Labels**  
   - **Purpose**: To indicate that certain features are still in the design or initial development phase.  
   - **Benefit**: Ensures visibility into early-stage tasks before they move into active development.  

## 6. **Explicit Task Descriptions**  
   - **Purpose**: To provide clarity on each development task (e.g., ‘Develop upload button’ or ‘Emailing API’).  
   - **Benefit**: Improves collaboration by making tasks easy to understand.  

## 7. **Linked Issues**  
   - **Purpose**: To ensure development tasks align with user story requirements.  
   - **Linked Issue**: *"User Story Creation"* from **Assignment 6** serves as a reference for defining and aligning tasks with required user stories.  
   - **Benefit**: Helps track progress against initial requirements and ensures all features are built as per defined user needs.  

These customizations improve workflow visibility, streamline QA processes, and provide a structured approach to handling blocked tasks efficiently.
