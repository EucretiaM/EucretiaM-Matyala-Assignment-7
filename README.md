Customization Choices in Task Management Board

## 1. **Added ‘Testing’ Column**
   - Purpose: To align with QA (Quality Assurance) requirements and ensure tasks are properly tested before deployment.
   - Benefit: Provides a clear distinction between completed development work and tasks that need verification before release.

## 2. **Separated ‘Done’ from ‘Testing’**
   - Purpose: To track tasks that have been implemented but require validation before being fully marked as completed.
   - Benefit: Helps in maintaining accountability and preventing premature closure of tasks.

## 3. **Maintained ‘Todo’ and ‘In Progress’ Columns**
   - Purpose: To organize tasks based on their current development state.
   - Benefit: Provides a clear workflow from ideation to execution.

## 4. **Task Categorization Using Draft Labels**
   - Purpose: To indicate that certain features are still in the design or initial development phase.
   - Benefit: Ensures visibility into early-stage tasks before they move into active development.

## 5. **Explicit Task Descriptions**
   - Purpose: To provide clarity on each development task (e.g., ‘Develop upload button’ or ‘Emailing API’).
   - Benefit: Improves collaboration by making tasks easy to understand.

These customizations enhance workflow visibility.
