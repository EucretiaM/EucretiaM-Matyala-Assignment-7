## Kanban Board: A Tool for Workflow Management

A Kanban board is a management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. It assists development teams in establishing order in their daily tasks by customizing the board to meet project-specific criteria. Kanban boards utilize cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work and complete it effectively.

### Benefits of Using a Kanban Board

- **Mapping Work Stages**: Using a Kanban board allows me to map all the stages of my work process. By looking at the board, I can understand how work is processed. It provides a clear perspective on the flow of tasks and helps identify inefficiencies in the process.

- **Visualizing Potential Problems**: The Kanban board helps in visualizing potential problems in my workflow. For example, if I notice a column where tasks accumulate faster than they are completed, it indicates a bottleneck or temporary issue. This visibility enables the team to address problems promptly.

### Conclusion

Kanban boards are an effective tool for improving workflow transparency and efficiency, making them invaluable for development and service teams.
