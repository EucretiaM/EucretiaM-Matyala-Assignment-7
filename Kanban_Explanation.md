A kanban board is an management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. It can help development teams establish order in their daily work through customizing it to meet the criteria of the projects. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done.

Use the Kanban board helps me to map all the stages of my work process. When looking at the board, i should be able to understand how work is processed. The board gives me a clear perspective on the flow of tasks and help in identifying any inefficiencies in the process.    

The Kanban board helps me to visualizing potential problems in my process. The logic is simple, if i see a column in which tasks arrive faster than they leave, work will start to pile up, and the problem will become visible to the whole team. This may be caused by a temporary issue or a bottleneck in my process.
