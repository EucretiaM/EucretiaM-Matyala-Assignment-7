I tried to make/export Kanban board to a .md file but, it doesnt show as it is on projects. Please refer to the one in projects, I made projects accessible for referal, as it shows exactly what I did. I learnt that system design and system development need extensive research on how use needs or conceptual ideas would be trasnformed into the real-life system. User requirements are huge when it comes to system design. One has to do an extensive research otherwise the system may not serve what it was developed for.
